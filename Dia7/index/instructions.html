        <div  id="content">It's easy to play.</br> You will be shown two cards.
    You simply have to decide whether the second card is searched for higher or lower than the first card.</br> As you progress, you will be shown a new card. Choose higher or lower to decide whether it is searched for more or less than the previous card. The objective is to get the most right in a row. </br>If you get one wrong, you lose the game.</pre>
